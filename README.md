Simple chess player 3D made in OpenGL to learn the basics of the graphic programming.
## How to use
### The course of game
The course of game is read from file (path to this file is passed by first argument). Each line of file contains each move in the format: a2-b3 without beating and a2xb3 with beating.
### Rotate the chessboard
Use the mouse to rotate the camera around the board by arrows keys. You can come back to initial view by `esc` key.
### Play game
You can see next move by `space` key.
